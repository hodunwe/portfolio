## Welcome to Jimin's art portfolio ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

Welcome to portfolio page?
<br>
This page features a few of my digital and traditional artwork. For digital creations, I work mainly with the Procreate app on iPad (with Apple Pencil) or my old Wacom Intuous Comic (2015) using Clip Studio Paint Pro. Traditional works usually encompass standard graphite pencils. I am rather new to the practice, but occasionally my work will involve acrylic and watercolor paints. 

Below are some of my works which are also available for viewing on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tteoksoonie/).

_Do not respost any work(s) represented below._
